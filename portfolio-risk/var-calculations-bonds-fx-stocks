# LINEAR INSTRUMENTS
# 1. PORTFOLIO VAR
# $ VAR = The dollar amount of money that can be lost with certain degree of probability over a certain period of time. 
# i.e. 1 day $10,000 VAR at 5% confidence interval implies that there is a less than 5% chance that portfolio 
# can lose $10,000 or more during 1 day given current distribution assumptions. On a distribution chart that would be 
# a left tail with cut off set to 5%.

# Linear Value-at-Risk (FX, Equities, ETFs)
# $VAR = Portfolio $Vol * Confidence Interval =  Portfolio $ Vol * Inverse Normal CDF
# WHERE 
# $Vol = $ Volatility
# Inverse Normal CDF has probability of 99%, Mean of 0 and Standard Deviation of 1)
# Portfolio $ Volatility = Square root of Portfolio $ Variance
# Portfolio $ Variance = [w1,..wx]*[sigma-square*sigma...]*transposed[w1,...wx] = 
# [Vector of portfolio weights] * [variance covariance matrix of asset returns in the portfolio, => cov(x)]*transposed
# vector of portolio weights = w'*cov(portfolio rets)*w

# 2. Single Component (Undiversified VAR)
# $ VAR = Confidence level  * Asset Volatility * $MV (Market Value)
# Confidence Level = NormInv
# Daily VAR = Annualized VAR / Square Root(252)

# ***********************************************************************************
# Corporate Bond VAR (Simplified)
# Some theory for warm-up
# $DV01 per bps = [MD * $MV]/10,000
# $PX delta = dP/P = - MD * Yield delta = - MD * dY WHERE MD = Modified Duration, Yield delta = yield change, $PX=Bond PX
# Sigma Volatility of PX  = Vol(dP/P) = - MD * Vol(dY) = - Modified Duration * Yield Volatility

# Single component VAR
# $VAR = Confidence level * Yield Volatility * $MV = 2.33 * Sigma(dY) * $MV = 
# = Inverse Normal CDF (p=99%,mean=0,StDev=1) * $MV = NormInv(99%,0,1)*$MV

# Portfolio VAR
# [w1... wx] = $MV1... $MVn => $MV of each bond
# Bond price volatility variance covariance matrix  of [Sigma price squared, sigma p1*sigma p2] where
# Sigma price^2 = (MD * Sigma(dY))^2, and sigma p1*sigma p2 = MD1*Sigma(dY1)*MD2*Sigma(dY2)
# Portfolio $ Variance = vector of components weights * VarCovar matrix of price sigmas * transposed vector of weights
# Portfolio $ VAR = Squate root of $Variance * Confidence level  WHERE Confidence level (NormIjv = Inverse normal CDF)

# BONDS: Breaking down idiosynchratic & interest rate risks
# Plain Vanilla / Bullet Bond yield = Z-Spread + Benchmark Yield
# Therefore, Portfolio $VAR = Square Root of VAR(Benchmark)^2 + VAR(Z-Spread)^2
# Assumptions: Assuming 0% correlation between z-spreads and risk-free curve
# Z-spread VR can be bucketed for real-time monitoring
